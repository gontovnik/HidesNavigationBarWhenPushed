# HidesNavigationBarWhenPushed

A library, which adds the ability to hide navigation bar when view controller is pushed via `hidesNavigationBarWhenPushed` flag.

**FYI: I use Apple internal API to make it work. Please remember that Apple might reject your app during app review process.**

## Context

While hacking on various projects, time to time I get designs where view controller A has navigation bar, and view controller B doesn't have it. It was always a pain to make it work. I decided to hack on that â€“ and this is the result of that.

I hope that many people will find it useful too.

## Demo

### With interactive pop gesture recognizer

### Regular push and pop

## Requirements
* Xcode 9 or higher
* iOS 11.0 or higher (may work on previous versions, just did not test it)
* ARC
* Swift 4.1

## Example project

Open and run the **HidesNavigationBarWhenPushedExample** project in Xcode to see **HidesNavigationBarWhenPushed** in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

``` ruby
pod 'HidesNavigationBarWhenPushed'
```

### Manual

Add **HidesNavigationBarWhenPushed** folder into your project.

## Usage

1. Use provided `NavigationController` instead of `UINavigationController`
2. Use provided `ViewController` instead of `UIViewController`
3. Use provided `NavigationBar` instead of `UINavigationBar` (make sure you specify this explicitly when using Interface Builder)

`ViewController` contains a single property you have to worry about: `hidesNavigationBarWhenPushed`.

If value on the new view controller is set to `true` and on the current view controller is set to `false`, then when new view controller is pushed, navigation bar will remain in the previous view controller. If value on the new view controller set to `false` and on the current view controller is set to `false`, then when new view controller is pushed, navigation bar will be present only in the new view controller, but not in the current.

If it sounds confusing, please see the demo above.
